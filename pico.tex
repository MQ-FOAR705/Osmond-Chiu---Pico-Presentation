Organising sources and managing references are two common and time consuming tasks when doing research

Common problems with these tasks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Can't remember relevant source
\item Can't remember key line in source
\item Can't recall the topics covered in a source
\item Need to double check citations
\item Need to keep track of references for a bibliography

With these tools, you will be able to  
  \begin{itemize}
   \item annotate, highlight and tag webpages. 
  \item apply a search engine to index documents, automatically tag documents, search and text mine its contents, do analytics and data visualisations.
  \item create and manage references and bibliographies for any text editor and directly inside programs.

  \end{itemize}
